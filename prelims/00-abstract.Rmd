In this work, we describe and use optimal matching (OM) — a method widely used in sociological studies — to obtain pairwise distances between categorical sequences that represent the relationship and family history of a group of women over 40 years old. We then use the distances to perform clustering analysis, predict the scores of personality traits with $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN) and compare the performance of different approaches using the mean squared error (MSE) of the prediction. The different approaches are given by varying the calculation of the cost matrix, normalization of distances and handling of missing values in the sequences. Our aim is to explore the effects that the variations considered have on an unsupervised and a supervised distance-based method.
